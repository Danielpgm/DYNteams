        "synopsis" : "Dalam sebagian besar tulisannya, dia membawa serta para pembacanya pada pencarian identitas berupa perjalanan untuk mencari makna “rumah”. Tempat-tempat yang dikunjungi Agustinus bukanlah tempat-tempat yang nyaman, tenang, atau bahkan indah dalam kacamata tamasya. Tempat-tempat itu sering kali berada di perbatasan, di wilayah penuh konflik berlapis dengan masyarakat yang berupaya mencari atau mempertahankan identitas. Dari tempat-tempat ini, kita bisa mendapatkan refleksi yang sesuai dengan kegelisahan kita, juga pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang berkecamuk dalam benak kita dan terus relevan dari masa ke masa. Yaitu pertanyaan tentang identitas diri. Ini adalah pertanyaan yang justru semakin menguat di tengah dunia yang semakin mengglobal. Jalan Panjang untuk Pulang adalah kumpulan cerita dan esai dari berbagai lokasi yang pernah disinggahi Agustinus, yang mengajak kita untuk mengalami berbagai dimensi perjalanan. Dari perjalanan fisik hingga perjalanan batin. Dari melihat dunia luar hingga pulang ke dalam diri. Dari pencarian hingga penemuan makna yang hakiki.",

        "publisher" : "HarperAudio",
        "year" : 2016,
        "synopsis" : "In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be positive all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. \n For decades we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life.\"F*ck positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let's be honest, shit is f*cked, and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is his antidote to the coddling let's-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. \n Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - \"not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault\". Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. \n There are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.

Where do they come from? What would life be like without them? And what would happen if we opened them up, heated them up, cooled them down, pointed them in a different direction, or pressed this button? In Thing Explainer, Munroe gives us the answers to these questions and so many more. Funny, interesting, and always understandable, this book is for anyone—age 5 to 105—who has ever wondered how things work, and why.",

Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, including more than 28 million who’ve watched his TED Talk based on START WITH WHY -- the third most popular TED video of all time. \nSinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?\nPeople like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. \nSTART WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.",

Now, in an urgent, deeply personal, riveting plea, he shows us all how deep our problems lie, and what we can do to begin to fix them.\nBeginning with a letter to one of his Black nephews, he proceeds with reporting and reflections on his slave ancestors, his upbringing in the shadows of segregation, and his adult confrontations with politicians, activists, and scholars. In doing so, Lemon offers a searing and poetic ultimatum to America. He visits the slave port where a direct ancestor was shackled and shipped to America. He recalls a slave uprising in Louisiana, just a few miles from his birthplace. And he takes us to the heart of the 2020 protests in New York City.

As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.\nDriven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.\nThe development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution.

Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.",
